- 📝 Programming to me is like reading a book of Harry Potter. Sitting down feeling like you can conjure magic and make anything you want 🧙
- 🤸‍♂️ In my daily job scope, I work on microservices with Java/Kotlin, write integration code with Camel K and tinkering with Kubernetes, specifically using Helm, AKS, Operator framework and CRDs
- 🔭 Right now, I'm developing a few small projects and learning some of the latest technologies in my spare time
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Camel K, NextJS, Kotlin**
- 💬 Ask me about **Java, Kubernetes, Helm, Gitlab CI/CD**
- 🎥 Besides making web applications, I sometimes photograph memories and make videos (one of my favourites is this from [Norway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZIyPsi3KR4))
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like vehicles and enjoy driving; I used to transport people from point to point as a part-time job and I also have a certificate for flying solo in a [Sling 2 LSA](https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/images/stories/2012/sept/sling/lead.jpg) 🙂
